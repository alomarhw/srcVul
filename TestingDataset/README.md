This folder contains two subfolders:
1. **Snippet**: Contains example snippets explained in the paper.
2. **Data**: Contains testing datasets for four different systems.

## Snippet Folder
This folder contains the following files:
- **Figure5.txt**:

  This file is linked to the example snippet in the paper.

## Data Folder
This folder contains the following files:
- **libgd-2.3.0.tar.gz**: Testing data for the `libgd` system.
- **libvirt-1.1.0.tar.gz**: Testing data for the `libvirt` system.
- **linux-4.14.76.tar.gz**: Testing data for the `Linux` system.
